					<h2>- THE SHOWROOM -</h2>
					<p>
						The Bathroom Design showroom is strategically located in one of Malta’s busiest residential and
						commercial areas. The three-floor 6500sqm warehouse boasts the latest equipment to handle the
						large volumes of bathroom products, sanitary ware and tiles that are processed daily, and is
						invaluable part of the company’s success.

						Bathroom Design inaugurated the new refurbished floor of their Birkirkara showroom with a launch
						event on the 25th of June. It is thanks to the continued backing of leading firms such as
						Villeroy & Boch that Bathroom Design has been able to maintain its steady business and strong
						reputation for three decades. The brand new refurbishment coincides with Bathroom Design’s 30th
						year in business as one of Malta’s leading bathroom suppliers.
